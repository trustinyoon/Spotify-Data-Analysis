# Spotify-Discover-2gether
Choose a friend to discover brand new music with. We create an adventurous playlist curated to both of your tastes.

## Goal:
Analyze and synthesize 2 users' Spotify recent taste profiles so that we can create a playlist filled with brand new song recommendations for both of them to discover together. The playlist we curate will automatically end up in both of their spotify libraries. A novel way for people to socialize because the playlist is unique to them and can create a special experience for both to find new music together that matches their music tastes.
